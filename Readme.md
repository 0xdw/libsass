About
-----

Libsass is a C/C++ port of the Sass CSS precompiler. The original version was written in Ruby, but this version is meant for efficiency and portability.

This library strives to be light, simple, and easy to build and integrate with a variety of platforms and languages.

About Sass
----------

Sass is a CSS pre-processor language to add on exciting, new, 
awesome features to CSS. Sass was the first language of its kind
and by far the most mature and up to date codebase.

Sass was originally created by the co-creator of this library, 
Hampton Catlin (@hcatlin). The extension and continuing evolution
of the language has all been the result of years of work by Nathan
Weizenbaum (@nex3) and Chris Eppstein (@chriseppstein).
