# Contributing to LibSass

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to LibSass, which is hosted in the [Sass Organization](https://github.com/sass) on GitHub.
These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

LibSass is a library that implements a [sass language] [1] compiler. As such it does not directly interface with end users (frontend developers).
For direct contributions to the LibSass code base you will need to have at least a rough idea of C++, we will not lie about that.
But there are other ways to contribute to the progress of LibSass. All contributions are done via github pull requests.

You can contribute to the [LibSass documentation] [2] or provide additional [spec tests] [3] (we will gladly point you in the direction
of the dirty corners in LibSass). Foremost we rely on good and concise bug reports for issues the spec tests do not yet catch.
